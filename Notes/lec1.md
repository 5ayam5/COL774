# Lecture 1 (Logistics)

## Basic Info
1. Class timings: Tue, Wed, Fri (8:00 - 9:00 am)
2. Buffer days will be used to cover all 14 weeks in the reduced semester (about 6 classes)
3. Self-study material will be given in the same light

#### Who should do this course?
Anyone who is interested in knowing the basics of ML

## Pre-requisites
1. **MTL106** (Probability and Stochastic Processes): needed to understand predictions and the statistics
2. **~~COL201~~ COL106** (Data Structures and Algorithms): working with some common data structures and algorithms
3. **Linear Algebra** (mostly stuff covered in MTL101): needed to organise the data
4. **Calculus/Optimisations** (linear functions, convex functions, derivatives (partial and without), vector calculus): need to optimise stuff

## Evaluation
1. Assignments
	- 4 (3 individual + 1 in pairs)
	- Last one is competitive
	- About 3 weeks per assignment
	- No copying of code allowed whatsoever, only discussing ideas is allowed
	- Language: `Python` (for deep learning, `Pytorch` will be required)
	- Weightage: 35%
2. Minor
	- Prof. Parag prefers one minor system even in the regular semester
	- Weightage: 25%
3. Major - weightage: 40%  
(minor and major is open note, open book, open internet but proctored)
